# mandelbrot-py

Requirements:
pygame  
numba  
numpy  

Palette from https://lospec.com/palette-list/slso8
SLSO8 by Luis Miguel Maldonado

This project is actually pretty ass, FPS drops all the way down to ~5 even with numba.

Code could use some work, in particular the setting and resetting defaults by pressing S part.
