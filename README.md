Palette from https://lospec.com/palette-list/slso8  
SLSO8 by Luis Miguel Maldonado

## Controls

z - zoom out, x - zoom in  
c - decrease focus, v - increase  
arrow keys to move

s to set back defaults (go back to default view)

Note that zooming increases/decreases focus by a fixed small value. You would not normally have to increase/decrease focus yourself as this is automatically scaled by proportion.
