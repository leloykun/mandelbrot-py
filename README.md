# mandelbrot-py

Requirements:  
pygame  
numba  
numpy  

Palette from https://lospec.com/palette-list/slso8  
SLSO8 by Luis Miguel Maldonado

This project is actually pretty ass, FPS drops all the way down to ~5 even with numba.

Code could use some work, in particular the setting and resetting defaults by pressing S part.

## Controls

z - zoom out, x - zoom in  
c - decrease resolution, v - increase  
arrow keys to move  
s to set back defaults

Note that zooming increases/decreases resolution by a fixed small value
